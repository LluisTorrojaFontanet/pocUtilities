/**
 * JFreeSane is a pure-Java implementation of a <a href="http://sane-project.org/">SANE</a> client.
 * It allows users to implement programs that obtain images from a SANE server. The user must have a
 * SANE server running in order to use this client.
 * <p>
 * Typically, the programmer should obtain an instance of
 * {@link ad.au.com.southsky.jfreesane.SaneSession}, usually with one of the the
 * {@link ad.au.com.southsky.jfreesane.SaneSession#withRemoteSane} overloads.
